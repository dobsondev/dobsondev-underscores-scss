# DobsonDev Underscores SCSS

This starting WordPress theme is based on [Underscores](http://underscores.me/) with [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) hooked in for styling. Included with the theme are two shell scripts, one for OS X and one for Apache that will create the template theme for you. This version of the theme has been modified to use SCSS.

## How to Use

### DobsonDev Underscores Generator

The DobsonDev Underscores Generator is extremely easy to use. All you have to do is fill out the form on the generator page at [underscores.dobsondev.com](http://underscores.dobsondev.com/). Once you do that you'll be given a download containg a zip of your new starter theme.

This theme is extremely bare bones, but it's meant to be that way. The idea is that it provides an amazing starting place that you can then easily expand to suit your or your client needs. I use this theme when creating new websites for my clients because I would rather not write a theme from scratch every single time.

## Contributing

I'll accept any pull requests that seem useful or fix bugs present (especially if there is a better way to do the shell scripts). You should fork the main repo, create a feature branch, write your changes/fix some bugs and submit a pull request. I'll review the pull request and if it seems like a good change I'll test it out myself and then merge it in.
